  abstract = {In this paper, we explore some of the various issues that may occur in attempting to fit a dynamical systems (either agent- or continuum-based) model of urban crime to data on just the attack times and locations. We show how one may carry out a regression analysis for the model described by Short et al. (2008, Math. Mod. Meth. Appl. Sci.) by using simulated attack data from the agent-based model. It is discussed how one can incorporate the attack data into the partial differential equations for the expected attractiveness to burgle and the criminal density to predict crime rates between attacks. Using this predicted crime rate, we derive a likelihood function that one can maximise in order to fit parameters and/or initial conditions for the model. We focus on carrying out data assimilation for two different parameter regions, namely in the case where stationary and non-stationary crime hotspots form. It is found that the likelihood function is `flat' for large ranges of parameters, and that this has major implications for crime forecasting. Hence, we look at how one might carry out a goodness-of-fit and forecasting analysis for crime rates given the range of parameter fits. We show how one can use the Kolmogorov\textendash{}Smirnov statistic to assess the goodness-of-fit. The dynamical systems analysis of the partial differential equations proves invaluable to understanding how the crime rate forecasts depend on the parameters and their sensitivity. Finally, we outline several interesting directions for future research in this area where we believe that the combination of dynamical systems modelling, analysis, and data assimilation can prove effective in developing policing strategies for urban crime.},

  abstract = {A widespread approach to investigating the dynamical behaviour of complex social systems is via agent-based models (ABMs). In this paper, we describe how such models can be dynamically calibrated using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), a standard method of data assimilation. Our goal is twofold. First, we want to present the EnKF in a simple setting for the benefit of ABM practitioners who are unfamiliar with it. Second, we want to illustrate to data assimilation experts the value of using such methods in the context of ABMs of complex social systems and the new challenges these types of model present. We work towards these goals within the context of a simple question of practical value: how many people are there in Leeds (or any other major city) right now? We build a hierarchy of exemplar models that we use to demonstrate how to apply the EnKF and calibrate these using open data of footfall counts in Leeds.},

These agent-based simulations are typically used as offline tools and do not assimilate real time data from the environment. With more and more smart buildings equipped with sensor devices, it is possible to utilize real time sensor data to dynamically inform the simulations to improve simulation results. In this paper, we propose a method to assimilate real time sensor data in agent-based simulation of smart environments based on Particle Filters (PFs). The data assimilation aims to estimate the system state, i.e., people's location information in real time, and use the estimated states to provide initial conditions for more accurate simulation/prediction of the system dynamics in the future. We develop a PF-based data assimilation framework and propose a new resampling method named as component set resampling to improve data assimilation for multiple agents. The proposed framework and method are demonstrated and evaluated through experiments using a sparsely populated smart environment.},

Such phenomena may be triggered in life-threatening situations such as fires, explosions in crowded buildings. Emergency evacuation simulation has recently attracted the interest of a rapidly increasing number of scientists. This paper presents an Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation using Repast software to construct crowd evacuations for emergency response from an area under a fire. Various types of agents and different attributes of agents are designed in contrast to traditional modeling. The attributes that govern the characteristics of the people are studied and tested by iterative simulations. Simulations are also conducted to demonstrate the effect of various parameters of agents. Some interesting results were observed such as "faster is slower" and the ignorance of available exits. At last, simulation results suggest practical ways of minimizing the harmful consequences of such events and the existence of an optimal escape strategy.},

The WIPER simulation is essential to classification and prediction tasks, as the simulations model human activity, both in movement and cell phone activity, in an attempt to better understand crisis events. These Agent-Based simulations are parameterized with agent location data from the cellular service provider and agents inhabit a GIS space representative of the urban area. Simulations include models for normal and crisis behaviors in an urban setting. Simulations generate call activity and agent locations, similar to that generated by the observation of cell phone users in an urban setting. A taxonomy of crisis events is presented, which has simplified the development of the simulation. We present an overview of the design and implementation of the WIPER simulation along with validation and verification of the system and an evaluation of runtime characteristics.},

  abstract = {Investigating congestion in train rapid transit systems (RTS) in today's urban cities is a challenge compounded by limited data availability and difficulties in model validation. Here, we integrate information from travel smart card data, a mathematical model of route choice, and a full-scale agent-based model of the Singapore RTS to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the congestion dynamics than can be obtained through analytical modelling alone. Our model is empirically validated, and allows for close inspection of congestion and scaling dynamics. By adjusting our model, we can estimate the effective capacity of the RTS trains as well as replicate the penultimate station effect, where commuters travel backwards to the preceding station to catch a seat, sacrificing time for comfort. Using current data, the crowdedness in all 121 stations appears to be distributed log-normally. We find that increasing the current population (2 million) beyond a factor of approximately 10\% leads to an exponential deterioration in service quality. We also show that incentivizing commuters to avoid the most congested hours can bring modest improvements to the service quality. Finally, our model can be used to generate simulated data for statistical analysis when such data are not empirically available, as is often the case.},

  abstract = {Agent-based modeling is commonly used for studying complex system properties emergent from interactions among many agents. We present a novel data-driven agent-based modeling framework applied to forecasting individual and aggregate residential rooftop solar adoption in San Diego county. Our first step is to learn a model of individual agent behavior from combined data of individual adoption characteristics and property assessment. We then construct an agent-based simulation with the learned model embedded in artificial agents, and proceed to validate it using a holdout sequence of collective adoption decisions. We demonstrate that the resulting agent-based model successfully forecasts solar adoption trends and provides a meaningful quantification of uncertainty about its predictions. We utilize our model to optimize two classes of policies aimed at spurring solar adoption: one that subsidizes the cost of adoption, and another that gives away free systems to low-income households. We find that the optimal policies derived for the latter class are significantly more efficacious, whereas the policies similar to the current California Solar Initiative incentive scheme appear to have a limited impact on overall adoption trends.},

  abstract = {Agent-based methods are one approach for modelling complex social systems but one issue with these models is the large number of parameters that require estimation. This chapter examines the effect of using a genetic algorithm (GA) for the parameter estimation of an agent-based model (ABM) of burglary. One of the main issues encountered in the implementation was the computation time required to run the algorithm. Nevertheless a set of preliminary results were obtained, which indicated that visibility is the most important parameter in the decision of whether to burgle a house while accessibility was the least important. Such tools may eventually provide the means to gain a greater understanding of the factors that determine criminological behaviour.},
